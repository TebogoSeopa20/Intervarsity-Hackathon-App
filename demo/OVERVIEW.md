# Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Name

### Imbewu - AI-powered Food Safety Scanner for Child Health


## 🚀 Summary
### Imbewu is an AI-powered food safety scanner that identifies harmful ingredients, expired products, and counterfeit snacks. We're creating safer communities by empowering parents and caregivers with instant product safety information.

## ✨ Key Features
### • AI Product Scanning – Instant detection of unsafe snacks
### • Safety Alerts – Warnings on recalls & illegal ingredients
### • Vendor Ratings – Trustworthy shops verified by the community
### • Community Reporting – Collective action to protect children

## 💡 Inspiration

### • Thousands of children consume unsafe snacks daily
### • Informal vendors sell counterfeit, expired, or illegal products
### • Parents lack tools to detect harmful ingredients
### • Regulators can’t monitor every spaza shop or street vendor


## 📌 Future Improvements

### 1. **Offline Mode**  
   Enable scanning and risk alerts without internet, crucial for rural or low-connectivity areas.  

### 2. **Integration with Health Departments**  
   Sync verified dangerous snack reports with government and NGOs to trigger faster investigations.  

### 3. **School Dashboard**  
   Provide schools with a bulk-scanning and reporting system for tuckshops and vendors.  

### 4. **AI Nutrition Assistant**  
   Suggest healthier alternatives when a snack is flagged as unsafe or unhealthy.  

### 5. **Expanded Database**  
   Partner with regulators and researchers to build a national database of snacks and safety ratings.  

### 6. **Multi-language Support**  
   Add local South African languages to ensure inclusivity and accessibility.  

### 7. **Child-Friendly Gamification**  
   Encourage kids to “collect healthy snacks” and learn nutrition through playful interaction.  

### 8. **Vendor Verification System**  
   Allow vendors to register and display a “verified safe” badge, boosting trust in local communities.
