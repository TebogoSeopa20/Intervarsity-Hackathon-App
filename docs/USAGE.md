## 📌 Notes
### If you need to use our app, you have to first create an account and verify that email address because you cannot login without verifying the email addrees first. Since our app offers 3 different roles, to test all the roles you will have to create an account for each role using different emails. 
### After running the app it might require the environment variables. Please email me on seopatebogo10@gmail.com or Whatsapp/call me on 066 157 0078 so I can send you the environment variables.
